# Battlecode 2021 

This is my submission for MIT's Battlecode 2021 competition under the team `Atom`.

### Project Structure

The `Compiled Robots/` folder contains every version I compiled and submitted to the scrimmage servers/tournaments.
  
The `src/` folder contains my raw code for the different robots (including a few old robots as test bots) I made throughout the competition.
- My final submission was `atomFinalHS`, which was submitted to the high school tournament and placed 9th.

Other notable submissions include:
- `atomAlphaV14` - my muckrush bot which was submitted to the first sprint tourney and peaked at 11th place on the scrimmage rankings.
- `atomFinalQualifier`- my submission to the US Qualifiers Tournament, which placed 26th.
   
The rest of the files are used to run the client and were provided by the competition developers.
