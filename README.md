# Battlecode 2021 

This is my submission for MIT's Battlecode 2021 competition under the team name of `Atom`.

### Project Structure

The `Compiled Robots/` folder contains every version I compiled and submitted to the scrimmage servers/tournaments.
  
The `src/` folder contains my raw code for the different robots (including a few old robots as test bots) I made throughout the competition.
- My final submission was `atomFinalHS`, submitted to the high school tournament

Other notable submissions include:
- `atomAlphaV14`, my muckrush bot which was submitted to the first sprint tourney and peaked at 11th place on the scrimmage rankings.
- `atomFinalQualifier`, my submission to the US Qualifiers Tournament
   
The rest of the files are used to run the client and were provided by the competition developers.

### Useful Commands

- `./gradlew run`
    Runs a game with the settings in gradle.properties
- `./gradlew update`
    Update to the newest version! Run every so often
